    <h3>A Trip I took</h3>
    <div>
        In October 2022, I took a trip down to State College Pennsylvania with three friends to watch the annual Penn State 'White Out' game.
        This is a game where every fan dresses in White, the Nittany Lions' secondary color. We met up with another friend who was in his last year at Penn State university. 
        We drove from the Noth Shore of Massachusetts and it took about seven hours. It was a very fun weekend with cozy campfires, good food, hyped up tailgating, and a competitive football game.
        I had a really fun time wathcing the game and experiencing a collge football experience that was very different from my own undergraduate football fan experience at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

    <h3>Favorite Restaurant</h3>
    <div>
        <a href="https://bordercafe.com/">My Favorite Restaurant: The Border Cafe</a>
        <p>
            The Border Cafe is my favorite restaurant. It offers a tex-mex style of food with a wide-ranging menu. I have been going there since I was a little kid.
            The ambiance andd music really add to the experience and make every meal enjoyable. My favorite think to order is the blackened catfish fajitas.
            The 'Border' has always been very close to my childhood home so I had many opportunities to try different menu items and experienc different parts of the restaurant.
            Overall, I have never been disappointed with my dining experience there and wish them well!

            My favorite food is Chicken Parmesean. I like it best when it is served with either penne or linguini pasta. Also, there needs to be fresh tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to make it perfect. 
            A proper chicken breading/crust is also key. The chicken needs bread crumbs, flour, salt, bread crumbs, olive oil, and eggs at the very least for a crunchy breading. Finally, I like to add some fresh parsly on top of everything to give a nice flavor profile
